# Warwick-Report-Template
A template for students at the University of Warwick. This can be used to adapt for lab reports, projects and dissertations.


# How to use
Most of the files are filled with some standard text or some examples of figures / tables etc. Here is a little checklist for making your report:

- [ ] Make sure all new `tex` files are included in `Report.tex` with the           command `\include{ChpaterFolder/YourTexFile}` 

- [ ] Put images for figures in the correct chapter folder so you can keep all things organised

- [ ] Fill in all your details in the `Preamble` such as your name, title of the project, ackknowledgements and all the sort!

- [ ] Compile and look at your lovely work!

# Overleaf
Of course, one of the best online editors that gives you a side-by-side code and pdf is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), upload the files to your account. **Or even simpler**, you can find the template there by searching *"University of Warwick"* (or something similar).
